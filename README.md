### Frontend Form Rendering:

Each field is rendered based on type (text, email, number, image)

Image fields support file upload via Cloudinary (or mock upload)

Submission stores responses in MongoDB

### Limitations

Gemini integration is currently for free plan. 

File upload flow is basic; multiple images and progress tracking are not implemented.

Form editing after generation is minimal.

No validation beyond required fields on frontend.

No search or filtering for submissions in dashboard.

### Future Improvements

Upgrade Google Gemini API paid version.

Full Cloudinary upload support for multiple images and previews.

Add field validation rules (min/max, regex) in schema & frontend.

Improve dashboard: search, pagination, analytics.

Add role-based access and form sharing links with permissions.

Add dynamic form editing and versioning.

Add skeleton loader for loading states.
